# Advent of Code 2024

My participation attempt in Advent of Code 2024. This repository contains my implementations for the AOC puzzles which I've done so far. You can look into my implementations and suggest changes, if you want to. I'm trying to use modern standards and modern language features as a challenge.

## Programming Languages Used

I will spin a wheel consisting of Rust and C++ before every puzzle, and it decides in which language I'll implement the puzzle solver.

## Code Quality

The solutions here are mine, and most are my first attempts; hence, they are not polished and may feel dirty at times. They work, but may not be the most optimal or best solution to the problem. Pull requests are welcome :).
